        ABOUT ME <br>
        Hi! I'm Tahmina, a serious fashionista and dedicated web developer.
        <br>
        Not everyone suited to being their own boss. So if there's one place that has to be considered before you get
        all worked up and head to the nearest bank for a loan, it's to do some self-assessment and figure out why you
        want to run your own business. How prepared are you for it and where can you get ongoing support from?
        <br>
        Understanding your self, your motivations, strengths and weaknesses will provide you with a clearer idea of how
        suited you are to the role of self-emp0loyment and all it's pluses and minuses.
        <br>
