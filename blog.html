            <p class="card-text"> the women's gymnastics competition at the Tokyo Olympic games will kick off, and we
                will all get to see athletes like Simone Biles compete superhuman feats of strength and artistry. But
                that isn’t the only story. As team Germany headed to podium training today, they showcased a different
                kind of competition gear. Not the sleeveless or long-sleeved leotard which has been the standard since
                the 1930s, but a long-legged unitard. A new sight at the Olympic Games, sure, but Team Germany has been
                rocking them since earlier this year. Their outfits are, according to the German Gymnastics Federation,
                a statement against, “against sexualization in gymnastics.” </p>

            <p class="card-text">Warm weather brings out a parade of vibrant looks and definitely-try-this-at-home
                trends. Based on our street style coverage from four cities—Sydney, Paris, Florence, and Milan—the
                summer of 2021 will be remembered for three major looks: statement-making animal prints, flirtatious
                fringe, and the essential leather topper, a go-to staple for summer’s chillier nights. Below, see how
                each city’s showgoers styled these summer trends</p>

            <p class="card-text">In the Before Times, way back in July 2019, the fall couture season was characterized
                by lively summertime florals, vibrant sequined looks, and tailored blazers. Last week showgoers made
                their post-pandemic comeback with looks that ran the gamut from plaid prints to racy see-through
                fabrics. Below, the then and now of Paris street style in July.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Sunglasses might be a small accessory, but they have a large impact. A great pair can
                elevate your outfit and your style, but the best sunglasses for women can boost your mood too. After a
                year spent mostly indoors, this spring and summer call for getting outside—and you’re going to need a
                great new pair of shades when you do.

                So what does summer have in store for eyewear? An everyday exuberance to match the season’s optimistic
                fashion. On the runway, the season brought us bright-colored clothing and eccentric prints, and for
                sunglasses, this means a pair of statement-making glasses.

                Among the best offerings, shop pairs with square-shaped rims and colored tinted lenses or cheeky
                cat-eyes done up to look like a new classic. Or consider a style that delivers a quirky take on a
                mainstay trend like oversized ’60s mod shades or retro aviators. Should you want your glasses to make a
                statement that all can hear, opt for a pair that doubles as jewelry. An option from Chanel comes
                complete with a pearl-strung sunglasses chain, while Magda Butrym’s collaboration with Linda Farrow is
                decked out in removable bling.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Fashion’s favorite color family? Earth tones. Seems the months spent predominantly
                indoors over the past year-plus have incited a penchant for clothing in colorful hues evoking Mother
                Nature.

                While there are always vibrant, mood-boosting colors en mode at any given time, the chosen colors of
                2021 are symbolic, too. We’re gravitating toward hues that most closely mirror the great outdoors, like
                the deep rusts, umbers, and oranges of a Grand Canyon sunset.

                But, one color reigns supreme now more than ever: green. We’re picking up clothes in all of green’s
                hues, from mint and sage to Kelly and evergreen. And it’s no surprise, out of all the colors in the
                spectrum, it’s green that most closely connotes nature.

                While nature has always inspired designers, this sentiment feels even more true as we navigate through
                re-emergence. Wearing green is the closest you can come to taking a forest bath no matter where the day
                takes you.</p>
